        "Consider the game of Can't Stop. This is a board game made back in 1981 and is a game where a group of players use their analysis of risk and suspeptibility to gambling to see who can first fill a certain number of columns by rolling two dice. In specific the rules of Can't Stop are as follows: <br>\n",
        "\n",
        "- There are 10 columns, each labelled sequentially from $2$ to $12$. <br>\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- Each player takes turns one at a time. <br>\n",
        "\n",
        "- On their turn, a player rolls four dice. They then choose to pair off the four dice into two sums. For example if the dice yield the numbers $\\{6,5,4,2\\}$ then the following sets of sums can be chosen: $\\{(11,6), (10,7). (8,9)\\}$. <br>\n",
        "\n",
        "- A player must choose a set of sums which corresponds to their 'runners'. Runners are pieces that represent valid sum values. Each player can only have 3 runners. After selecting a sum that is valid for a runner, that runner is moved up one place in a column. If the player has no runners out, then they are placed to make a set of chosen sums valid and if no sums available are valid, then the player busts.  <br>\n",
        "\n",
        "- When a player busts their turn ends and all runners are removed from the board. <br>\n",
        "\n",
        "- After choosing a valid set of sums, the player has the choice to stop rolling. This turns all runners into saved progress along a column. <br>\n",
        "\n",
        "- If a players saved progress in a column is equal to the length of the column they 'socre' the column. The first player to score 5 columns wins. <br>\n",
        "\n",
        "This game is relatively simple, being one where players must understand basic probability rules along with the board state to make smart decisions. However this simple game has a considerable number of strategies. For example; one may notice that the '2' and '12' columns only require 3 values to completed. While these sums occur with low likeyhood it may be a valid strategy to invest in these columns over others. On the other hand, a player may realize that 7 is the most common result and attempt to have a runner in 7 no matter what. While these are two very different strategies, both seem very valid. This begs the question of \"What is the optimal way to play\". <br>\n",

However, this naive idea has an issue when we consider the length of columns. Since the safest options have the longest columns to progress through, a player only playing safely will lose against a player that takes some risk. As such a simple 'classical' optimization of the probabilities is not desired. Instead, our definition of optimal is very simple. Thus our definition of optimal is: <br>\n",

        "To start we will only consider a two-player game. In reality, the data found from the two-player game could easily be used to generate a competent multiplayer game, but to simplify the problem from a computational standpoint let's only consider a game with two players. <br>\n",
        "This makes the state space much simpler, as we do not need to consider whose turn it is. Instead, we can construct a state space where we are always the player playing and allow the 'enemy' to use the same state space, but with roles reversed. This brings the question of \"how do we represent the game\". Well, when one player is playing the player has the following information: \n",
        "- The progress of the player in each column.\n",
        "- The location/progress of their runners.  \n",
        "- The options of sums to take. \n",
        "- The progress of the enemy in each column. \n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "This is all the information present to a player during their turn. Now to represent the information. Since this game has been simulated via a python code, the choice of representation is somewhat forced. To start, the progress of each player can be represented by a numpy shape (11,) vector. Each entry is an integer representing the distance a player is from finishing. Since this is a two-player game, we require two (11,) shape vectors. The progress and location of the runners can be similarly recorded by a numpy shape (11,) whose integer entries represent the amount each runner has gone in each column. To denote the choice of columns a value of 0 just means a player has no runner in this column.  <br>\n",
        "While this seems fine, we have found a bit of an issue. The methods used in class require a player to somehow traverse the state space, somehow learning the validity of actions (which is a bit more of a complicated interaction we will describe later). Thus we must ask ourselves, how big is the state space.\n",
        "Well, each player vector can be represented by 3 ways in the first column, 5 ways in the second etc etc... this gives an upper estimate of $3^25^27^29^211^213 = 1404728325$ possibilities. Now since our state space was so simply constructed, we can use an upper estimate on the total size of the state space by taking three of these vectors. Considering them to be independent (technically the runner one is not but... we are looking at an upper bound so its fine) we get an upper bound on the size of the state space to be $1404728325^3 = 2.7718966e+27$. This is an insane size for a state space. While this is an upper estimate, even if only 0.01% of these states are even attainable or valid, the game has too many states. Instead, we will tackle this problem by using machine learning to tailor an AI as a player. This can be done, but we need to better understand how people play this game.  "

For example, risky players are intinsically trying to use the skewed column lengths to their advantage, while conservative players with to use the probability distribution of two dice to their advantage. There are a few other interations that exist and can be implemented into our strategies. For example a could try to _snake_ an opponents column by completing it just as they closeto completion. In general these strategies will be called \"behaviours\" and we somehow need a way to represent these behaviours. To start we will quantify risky behaviour in a seemingly roundabout way.\n"

That is to say the 7 column needs 13 successful rolls to complete while the 2 column only needs 3. This skewed length naturally attempt to use the fact that the 2 and 12 columns in Can't Stop are incredibly short. This skewed length should be weighed in by our optimal player, but what makes a choice of 2 more desirable then a choice of 7. Consider if our player _chooses_ that they like 6 twice as much than 7, 5 twice as much as 6 etc etc etc. This person is simply taking this 'optimal' distribution and changing it by a weighting vector of: \n",

But since we already have a representation of the players \"wants\" through its behavior profile, consider that a player is successful after enough of its wants are satisfied. This is actually quantifiable since the behavior profile is supposed to show a players wants. If we sum the wants satisfied by every action in a turn we can quantify the 'player satisfaction' as a number $S$. Once the player's satisfaction has hit some threshold, then they should stop their turn. Representing a successful turn this way is very alluring as calculating probabilities is never directly done and their calculations are imagined to be a relatively difficult both computationally and conceptually. With all of these considered, we can produce the following 'pseudo code' for a player.\n",

        "The AI as written now, has a deterministic actor that is being trained by a very simple value function, this being the scoring state function. The issue doesn't come from using this hacked value iteration method, but instead from the object we are taking the gradient of. That is the playerScoring function or $p(S)$. This function attempts to emulate what is normally a probability distribution by instead taking the valid option and taking on a subtraction sign with the satisfy value. This naive (and retroactively dumb) choice forces the derivative to be a constant negative value with respect to the satisfy value, leading to the incredible -200 after 300 training games. While this method failed, it can be saved. It just requires us to change our functions to better encapsulate the concept of 'probability distriubion' as seen in the course in so far. \n",

To start, lets produce a probability distribution from our scored options. This can be done by using jnp.softmax on our scored options. We can then choose a choice_index by randomly picking a column. The code for this was actually made in assignment one, so we will just reuse our code from there and call it chooseIndex. All in all, this changes our choice_index line as follows:\n",

        "To better run our AI we could have done a large number of things. Each thing will be mentioned, explaining how it _should_ affect the AI and why we chose not to incorporate it.\n",
        "- Vectorization: From our work we found good success against the training AI given after a few hundred sessions. Since this took only a few minutes, we thought there would be no need to vectorize it. If we were to vectorize it, we would need to change our changeTheta function to do some a vector product between our thetas and our gradients. \n",
        "- Learing rate scaling: Normally when you do machine learning, you allow the machine to learng at a variable rate. This represents having faith that your AI will start to converge to some solution after the initial set of updates. This could have even pushed us to do vectorization as we may have needed considerably more runs to train our AI. Though because of the seemingly good optima that is reached in a relatively short number of trianing sessions, we thought there was no need to actually scale our learning rate. (For the evolutionary algorithim this could have come in the form of different mutation types). \n",
        "- Incorporate a critic function: We could have incorporated a critic function to faster training. If implemented, we could have used a 'specalized critic' where we would only look for certain actions and then learn from these. (For example, if our AI went from losing to winning, learng from this turn). This would let us avoid having to change the critic function and would have let us look for certain types of strategies specifically. \n",
        "- Evolutionary algorith self play: We could have had it train against itself, but it would involve changing the simulation again and couple of other tedious changes. Instead, we decided to only play against the enemy AIs as provided in the library. \n",
        "- Evolutionary algorithim better fitness function: We could have generated a better fitness function that just straight win percentages. One of these could have been incorporating how many times one of our AI's was ahead with columns. The rational being if a has more column completed then their enemies for longer, then they are actually playing very well. \n",
        "- Optimizing the evolutionary algorithim: The evolutionary algorithim was pretty succesful at its training but had a ration of 100*1 in terms of time it took to train each episode. This insane increase in time is probably due to operations that are just not optimal that being used. This should have been optimized in some sort of way. For example, the Evo Alg could have looked at the total number of turns an AI was ahead of its opponent for less games, or the physical calculations could have been better implmented.  \n",
        "- Looking at our enemies: We could have explicitly looked at the enemy’s board state. This was technically never done. Mainly as it was planned as an extension to greedy and given greedy's preformance it was scrapped. This is probably the biggest missed change that would have made our AI signifincatly more successful.\n",
